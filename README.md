# Easy Connect - Easily add all supported connectivity methods to your Mbed OS project

## Deprecation note

Please note that with [Mbed OS 5.10](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/tree/mbed-os-5.10) onwards the network driver can be instantiated using `get_default_instance()`.

**This repository will not be maintained going onwards, as the work will be done using the [official Mbed OS repository](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os).**

More information will be available in the [Mbed OS Handbook](https://os.mbed.com/docs/v5.10) under [Network interfaces](https://os.mbed.com/docs/v5.10/apis/network-interfaces.html) and [configuration](https://os.mbed.com/docs/v5.10/reference/configuration-connectivity.html#selecting-the-default-network-interface). There are also [examples](https://github.com/search?q=mbed-os-example&type=Repositories) available.

## Old README.md

The [old README](README-old.md) is still available.
